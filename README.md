# KPMG-Career-Analyst-Internship-Program
This project involved Tax Research, Data Modeling, Data Manipulation, Excel Modeling, Team Building and Critical Thinking.

The main objectives were to learn about:
- Tax Research and Memorandum
- Evaluating Data
- State Tax Exposure
- Types of Tax & Cross Selling

We were briefly taught about these topics and were given extensive resources to read from and understand each part of the simulation. 
We were given a problem based on a company for which we needed to analyze the tax trends in two different areas and figure out the best possible region to set up a new branch. 

For this, we first prepared a report based on various calculations, using the IRAC format (Issues, Research, Analysis and Conclusion) (TASK 1)

Our second task, was to clean and process the data given in the excel sheet, to remove all inconsistencies and prepare it for analysis.

For our third task, we had to model the data given till 2020 and use pivot tables to find out the following projected data for 2022:
- PA ApportionmentÂ Percentage 
- PA Taxable Income
- PA Tax Liability

We were then taught the types of taxes and the sectors they come under.
